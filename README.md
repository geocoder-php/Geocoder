**Geocoder** is a PHP library which helps you build geo-aware applications by
providing a powerful abstraction layer for geocoding manipulations.

Providers
---------

Providers perform the geocoding black magic for you (talking to the APIs,
fetching results, dealing with errors, etc.) an are highly configurable.

### Address-based Providers

**Important:** the [Geocoder
Extra](https://github.com/geocoder-php/geocoder-extra) library contains even
more official providers!

HTTP Adapters
-------------

In order to talk to geocoding APIs, you need HTTP adapters. While it was part of
the library in Geocoder 1.x and 2.x, Geocoder 3.x and upper now relies on the
[PSR-7
Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md)
which defines how HTTP message should be implemented. Choose any library that
follows this PSR and implement the specified interfaces to use with Geocoder.

As making choices is rather hard, Geocoder ships with the
[egeloen/http-adapter](https://github.com/egeloen/ivory-http-adapter) library by
default, but it is up to you to choose a different implementation.

**Note:** not all providers are HTTP-based.


Installation
------------

The recommended way to install Geocoder is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

```
$ composer require willdurand/geocoder
```


Usage
-----

[Geocoder](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder) and its companion
[Geocoder Extra](https://github.com/geocoder-php/geocoder-extra) provides a lot
of providers.

Choose the one that fits your need first. Let's say the `GoogleMaps` one is what
you were looking for, so let's see how to use it. In the code snippet below,
`curl` has been choosen as HTTP layer but it is up to you since each HTTP-based
provider implements
[PSR-7](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md).

```php
$curl     = new \Geocoder\HttpAdapter\CurlHttpAdapter();
$provider = new \Geocoder\Provider\GoogleMapsProvider($curl);
$geocoder = new \Geocoder\Geocoder($provider);


$geocoder->geocode(...);
$geocoder->reverse(...);
```

The `Geocoder` interface, which all providers implement, exposes two main
methods:

* `geocode($streetOrIpAddress)`
* `reverse($latitude, $longitude)`

It also contains methods to control the number of results:

* `limit($limit)`
* `getLimit()`

Both `geocode()` and `reverse()` methods return an array of `Address` objects,
each providing the following API:

* `getCoordinates()` will return a `Coordinates` object (with `latitude` and
  `longitude` properties);
* `getLatitude()` will return the `latitude` value;
* `getLongitude()` will return the `longitude` value;
* `getBounds()` will return an `Bounds` object (with `south`, `west`, `north`
  and `east` properties);
* `getStreetNumber()` will return the `street number/house number` value;
* `getStreetName()` will return the `street name` value;
* `getLocality()` will return the `locality` or `city`;
* `getPostalCode()` will return the `postalCode` or `zipcode`;
* `getSubLocality()` will return the `city district`, or `sublocality`;
* `getCounty()` will return a `County` object (with `name` and `code`
  properties);
* `getCountyCode()` will return the `county` code (county short name);
* `getRegion()` will return a `Region` object (with `name` and `code`
  properties);
* `getRegionCode()` will return the `region` code (region short name);
* `getCountry()` will return a `Country` object (with `name` and `code`
  properties);
* `getCountryCode()` will return the ISO `country` code;
* `getTimezone()` will return the `timezone`.

### Locale Aware Providers

Providers that are _locale aware_ expose the following methods:

```php
$geocoder->setLocale('xyz');

$locale = $geocoder->getLocale();
```

### GoogleMaps

Locale and/or region can be specified:

```php
$geocoder = new \Geocoder\Provider\GoogleMaps(
    $httpAdapter,
    $locale,
    $region,
    $useSsl // true|false
);
```

### GoogleMapsBusiness

A valid `Client ID` is required. The private key is optional. This provider also
supports SSL, and extends the `GoogleMaps` provider.

### Nominatim

Access to a Nominatim server is required. See the [Nominatim Wiki
Page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) for more information.

### Yandex

The default language-locale is `ru-RU`, you can choose between `uk-UA`, `be-BY`,
`en-US`, `en-BR` and `tr-TR`. This provider can also reverse information based
on coordinates (latitude, longitude). It's possible to precise the toponym to
get more accurate result for reverse geocoding: `house`, `street`, `metro`,
`district` and `locality`.

### MaxMindBinary

This provider requires a data file, and the
[geoip/geoip](https://packagist.org/packages/geoip/geoip) package must be
installed.

It is worth mentioning that this provider has **serious performance issues**,
and should **not** be used in production. For more information, please read
[issue #301](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder/issues/301).

### GeoIP2

It requires either the [database
file](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/), or the
[webservice](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/web-services/) - represented by
the GeoIP2 , which is injected to the `GeoIP2Adapter`. The
[geoip2/geoip2](https://packagist.org/packages/geoip2/geoip2) package must be
installed.

This provider will only work with the corresponding `GeoIP2Adapter`:

``` php
<?php

// Maxmind GeoIP2 Provider: e.g. the database reader
$reader   = new \GeoIp2\Database\Reader('/path/to/database');

$adapter  = new \Geocoder\Adapter\GeoIP2Adapter($reader);
$geocoder = new \Geocoder\Provider\GeoIP2($adapter);

$address   = $geocoder->geocode('74.200.247.59');
```

### TomTom

The default langage-locale is `en`, you can choose between `de`, `es`, `fr`,
`it`, `nl`, `pl`, `pt` and `sv`.

### ArcGISOnline

It is possible to specify a `sourceCountry` to restrict result to this specific
country thus reducing request time (note that this doesn't work on reverse
geocoding).

### The ProviderAggregator

The `ProviderAggregator` is used to register several providers so that you can
decide which provider to use later on.

``` php
<?php

$geocoder = new \Geocoder\ProviderAggregator();

$geocoder->registerProviders([
    new \Geocoder\Provider\GoogleMaps(
        $adapter, $locale, $region, $useSsl
    ),
    new \Geocoder\Provider\GoogleMapsBusiness(
        $adapter, '<CLIENT_ID>', '<PRIVATE_KEY>', $locale, $region, $useSsl
    ),
    new \Geocoder\Provider\Yandex(
        $adapter, $locale, $toponym
    ),
    new \Geocoder\Provider\MaxMind(
        $adapter, '<MAXMIND_API_KEY>', $service, $useSsl
    ),
    new \Geocoder\Provider\ArcGISOnline(
        $adapter, $sourceCountry, $useSsl
    ),
]);

$geocoder->registerProvider(
    new \Geocoder\Provider\Nominatim(
        $adapter, 'http://your.nominatim.server', $locale
    )
);

$geocoder
    ->using('google_maps')
    ->geocode('...');

$geocoder
    ->limit(10)
    ->reverse($lat, $lng);
```

The `ProviderAggregator`'s API is fluent, meaning you can write:

``` php
<?php

$addresses = $geocoder
    ->registerProvider(new \My\Provider\Custom($adapter))
    ->using('custom')
    ->limit(10)
    ->geocode('68.145.37.34')
    ;
```

The `using()` method allows you to choose the `provider` to use by its name.
When you deal with multiple providers, you may want to choose one of them.  The
default behavior is to use the first one but it can be annoying.

The `limit()` method allows you to configure the maximum number of results being
returned. Depending on the provider you may not get as many results as expected,
it is a maximum limit, not the expected number of results.

### The Chain Provider

The `Chain` provider is a special provider that takes a list of providers and
iterates over this list to get information. Note that it **stops** its iteration
when a provider returns a result. The result is returned by `GoogleMaps` because
`FreeGeoIp` and `HostIp` cannot geocode street addresses. `BingMaps` is ignored.

``` php
$geocoder = new \Geocoder\ProviderAggregator();
$adapter  = new \Ivory\HttpAdapter\CurlHttpAdapter();

$chain = new \Geocoder\Provider\Chain([
    new \Geocoder\Provider\FreeGeoIp($adapter),
    new \Geocoder\Provider\HostIp($adapter),
    new \Geocoder\Provider\GoogleMaps($adapter, 'fr_FR', 'France', true),
    new \Geocoder\Provider\BingMaps($adapter, '<API_KEY>'),
    // ...
]);

$geocoder->registerProvider($chain);

try {
    $geocode = $geocoder->geocode('10 rue Gambetta, Paris, France');
    var_export($geocode);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

Everything is ok, enjoy!


Dumpers
-------

**Geocoder** provides dumpers that aim to transform an `Address` object in standard formats.

### GPS eXchange Format (GPX) ###

The **GPS eXchange** format is designed to share geolocated data like point of
interests, tracks, ways, but also coordinates. **Geocoder** provides a dumper to
convert an `Address` object in an GPX compliant format.

Assuming we got a `$address` object as seen previously:

``` php
<?php

$dumper = new \Geocoder\Dumper\Gpx();
$strGpx = $dumper->dump($address);

echo $strGpx;
```

It will display:

``` xml
<gpx
    version="1.0"
    creator="Geocoder" version="1.0.1-dev"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0 http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0/gpx.xsd">
    <bounds minlat="2.388911" minlon="48.863151" maxlat="2.388911" maxlon="48.863151"/>
    <wpt lat="48.8631507" lon="2.3889114">
        <name><![CDATA[Paris]]></name>
        <type><![CDATA[Address]]></type>
    </wpt>
</gpx>
```

### GeoJSON ###

[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) is a format for encoding a variety of geographic
data structures.


### Keyhole Markup Language (KML) ###

[Keyhole Markup Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language)
is an XML notation for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within
Internet-based, two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers.


### Well-Known Binary (WKB) ###

The Well-Known Binary (WKB) representation for geometric values is defined by
the OpenGIS specification.


### Well-Known Text (WKT) ###

Well-known text (WKT) is a text markup language for representing vector geometry
objects on a map, spatial reference systems of spatial objects and
transformations between spatial reference systems.


Formatters
----------

A common use case is to print geocoded data. Thanks to the `StringFormatter`
class, it's simple to format an `Address` object as a string:

``` php
<?php

// $address is an instance of Address
$formatter = new \Geocoder\Formatter\StringFormatter();

$formatter->format($address, '%S %n, %z %L');
// 'Badenerstrasse 120, 8001 Zuerich'

$formatter->format($address, '<p>%S %n, %z %L</p>');
// '<p>Badenerstrasse 120, 8001 Zuerich</p>'
```

Here is the mapping:

* Street Number: `%n`

* Street Name: `%S`

* City: `%L`

* City District: `%D`

* Zipcode: `%z`

* County: `%P`

* County Code: `%p`

* Region: `%R`

* Region Code: `%r`

* Country: `%C`

* Country Code: `%c`

* Timezone: `%T`


Extending Things
----------------

You can write your own `provider` by implementing the `Provider` interface.

You can provide your own `dumper` by implementing the `Dumper` interface.


Versioning
----------

Geocoder follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

### End Of Life

As of December 2014, branch `1.7` is not officially supported anymore, meaning
major version `1` reached end of life. Last version is:
[1.7.1](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder/releases/tag/1.7.1). This
branch did not receive any new fixes over the last year, and all plugins/modules
require Geocoder `~2.0`.

### Stable Version

Stable version
[2.0.0](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder/releases/tag/2.0.0) has been
released on July 2013, and it is the only known stable major version. Branch
[`2.x`](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder/tree/2.x) is used to contribute
bug and/or security fixes, and that is the one you should use in order to
contribute.

Latest version is:
[2.8.1](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder/releases/tag/2.8.1).

**Important:** as of December 2014, this version is in a **feature freeze**
state. All new features should be contributed to (upcoming) version 3.0.

**Important:** version 2.0.0 does not have any EOL date scheduled yet.

### Next Version

Version 3.0.0 is the next major version of Geocoder. You can take a look at the
[`master`](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder/tree/master) branch in order
to follow its development. That is also why it is a bad idea to require
`dev-master` into your `composer.json` file.

Branch `2.x` is merged into `master` time to time, so that all bug/security
fixes contributed to the current stable version will also appear in the next
version.


Contributing
------------

See
[`CONTRIBUTING`](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing)
file.


Unit Tests
----------

In order to run the test suite, install the developement dependencies:

```
$ composer install --dev
```

Then, run the following command:

```
$ phpunit
```

You'll obtain some _skipped_ unit tests due to the need of API keys.

Rename the `phpunit.xml.dist` file to `phpunit.xml`, then uncomment the
following lines and add your own API keys:

``` xml
<php>
    <!-- <server name="IPINFODB_API_KEY" value="YOUR_API_KEY" /> -->
    <!-- <server name="BINGMAPS_API_KEY" value="YOUR_API_KEY" /> -->
    <!-- <server name="GEOIPS_API_KEY" value="YOUR_API_KEY" /> -->
    <!-- <server name="MAXMIND_API_KEY" value="YOUR_API_KEY" /> -->
    <!-- <server name="GEONAMES_USERNAME" value="YOUR_USERNAME" /> -->
    <!-- <server name="TOMTOM_GEOCODING_KEY" value="YOUR_GEOCODING_KEY" /> -->
    <!-- <server name="TOMTOM_MAP_KEY" value="YOUR_MAP_KEY" /> -->
    <!-- <server name="GOOGLE_GEOCODING_KEY" value="YOUR_GEOCODING_KEY" /> -->
    <!-- <server name="OPENCAGE_API_KEY" value="YOUR_API_KEY" /> -->
</php>
```

You're done.
