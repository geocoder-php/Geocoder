Contributing
============

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before
maintainers accept and merge your work.

You MUST follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and
[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). If you don't know about any of them, you
should really read the recommendations. Can't wait? Use the [PHP-CS-Fixer
tool](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/).

You MUST run the test suite.

You MUST write (or update) unit tests.

You SHOULD write documentation.

Please, write [commit messages that make
sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
before submitting your Pull Request.

One may ask you to [squash your
commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want
commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).

Thank you!
