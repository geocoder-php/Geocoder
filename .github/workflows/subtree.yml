# This GitHub Action will push code for each provider/component to its own repository.
# This is useful to have a better overview of the code and to have a better control over the releases.
# The subtree is pushed to a repository named `geocoder-php/{provider}-provider`.
# Previously, this process used https://www.subtreesplit.com/ service.
#
# This worflow is based on GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository
# This workflow uses https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo tool.
#
# This workflow needs a GitHub token with Contents and Workflows read & write scopes.
